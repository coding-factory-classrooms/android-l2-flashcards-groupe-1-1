#How you can extract an APK file using Android Studio?

    1 In the Android menu, go to Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK (s) > Build APK(s).
    2 Android Studio will start building the APK for you. Once done, a pop-up on the bottom right will notify you of its completion. Click the ‘locate’ button in this dialog.
    3 The ‘locate’ button should open File Explorer with the debug folder open that contains a file called “app-debug.apk”.
    4 That’s it. Rename this file and share!
